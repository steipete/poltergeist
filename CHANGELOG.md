## [1.0.0-beta.1] - 2025-08-03

### üö® Critical Fixes

#### Fixed
- **Mac app state file parsing for projects with hyphens**: Previously, the macOS companion app would fail to correctly identify projects or targets with hyphens in their names (e.g., `my-project`, `my-target`). Now uses robust regex parsing to correctly extract the 8-character hash regardless of hyphen usage.
- **Staleness threshold consistency**: Eliminated confusing behavior where the Mac app would show projects as "stale" (30 seconds) while the CLI considered them active (5 minutes). Both now use a consistent 5-minute threshold.
- **CI pipeline test execution order**: Fixed `dist/pgrun.js` missing module errors by ensuring builds complete before tests run.

### üîß Code Quality Improvements

#### Changed
- **Replaced custom glob matcher with picomatch**: Removed 70+ lines of custom pattern matching code and replaced it with the battle-tested [picomatch](https://github.com/micromatch/picomatch) library for more reliable and feature-complete glob matching.
- **Removed legacy status format support**: Cleaned up backward compatibility code for legacy `'failed'` vs `'failure'` status formats, simplifying the codebase.

#### Added
- **picomatch dependency**: Added `picomatch` and `@types/picomatch` for robust glob pattern matching.

### üìä Impact
- ‚úÖ All 318 tests passing
- ‚úÖ Critical production bugs eliminated  
- ‚úÖ Improved code maintainability (-76 net lines of code)
- ‚úÖ Better user experience consistency between CLI and Mac app

### üôè Acknowledgment
These improvements were identified through a comprehensive AI-powered code review that analyzed the entire codebase for bugs, inefficiencies, and improvement opportunities.
